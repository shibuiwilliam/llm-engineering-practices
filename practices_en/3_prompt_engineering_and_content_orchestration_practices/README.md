# Prompt Engineering & Content Orchestrations

**Overview**  
Prompt Engineering & Content Orchestrations is a set of practices that treats prompts not just as text but as design assets, enabling them to handle complex generation flows and dynamic requirements.  
By applying these practices, you can enhance the quality, reusability, and readability of prompts, and stably operate generation logic and branching across multiple steps.

- **Modularization**: Divide prompts into templates and sub-prompts for piecewise management  
- **Dynamic Assembly**: Reconfigure prompts based on user context and intermediate generation results  
- **Quality Assurance**: Detect side effects of prompt modifications through unit testing and statistical selection  
- **Multi-step Control**: Implement complex flows declaratively using Chain-of-Thought and Orchestration Engine  

## List of Included Practices

1. **Interpreter / Builder / Factory / Prototype / Strategy**
   - Interpreter / Builder / Factory / Prototype / Strategy are design approaches that separate prompt design from execution to achieve flexible prompt generation.
2. **Prompt Inheritance Command**
   - Prompt Inheritance Command is a design approach that organizes prompt generation structure based on inheritance and isolates execution processing as independent commands.
3. **Few-Shot Prompt**
   - Few-Shot Prompt is a design approach that adapts LLMs to specific tasks or domains by providing a small number of examples.
4. **Prompt Splitting Sharding Aggregation**
   - Prompt Splitting Sharding Aggregation is a design approach for efficiently processing large-scale text and long-form data.
5. **Self-Reflection Prompt**
   - Self-Reflection Prompt is a design approach that enhances output quality and reliability by having the LLM perform self-evaluation and correction.
6. **Few-Shot Prompt**
   - Few-Shot Prompt is a design approach that adapts LLMs to specific tasks or domains by providing a small number of examples.
7. **Domain-oriented Prompt Design**
   - Domain-oriented Prompt Design is a methodology for designing prompts specialized for specific domains or industries.
8. **Parallel World**
   - Parallel World is a design approach that executes prompt variations in parallel and selects the optimal results.
9. **User Environment**
   - User Environment is a design approach for adjusting prompts based on user context and environment.
10. **Prompt Performance Profiling**
    - Prompt Performance Profiling is a design approach for measuring and optimizing prompt performance.
11. **Prompt Drift Detection**
    - Prompt Drift Detection is a design approach for detecting prompt degradation and changes to maintain quality.
12. **Event Driven Prompt Orchestration**
    - Event-Driven Prompt Orchestration is a design practice that automatically chains prompt generation, LLM invocation, and subsequent processing triggered by events occurring within the application.
13. **System Prompt Control**
    - System Prompt Control is a methodology for designing system prompts to control LLM behavior.
14. **Idempotent Inference Request**
    - Idempotent Inference Request is a methodology for designing requests so that results remain unchanged even when sent multiple times.
