# Platform Integration & Abstraction Practices

**Overview**
Platform Integration & Abstraction Practices are a set of practices for implementing complex logic and applications using LLM APIs.
By adopting these practices, you can implement multi-vendor support, rate control, asynchronous batch processing, and complex workflow execution in a consistent manner.

- **Integration**: Add functionality while minimizing integration with existing services
- **Abstraction**: Handle model calls, storage, and workflows through common interfaces
- **Scalability**: Handle high traffic through rate control and load balancing
- **Operability**: Easily build observability, fault tolerance, and failover capabilities

## List of Included Practices

1. **Proxy for Rate-Limited Access**
   Centralize all requests through a proxy layer and perform throttling/queuing based on QPS and token consumption.
2. **Bridge for Storage & Execution**
   Separate the persistence layer (cache/DB) from the inference layer, making model calls and data storage independently extensible.
3. **LLM Service Interface Segregation**
   Break down a single interface into smaller responsibilities, minimizing model call logic to the essential.
4. **OpenAI Gateway**
   Provide a gateway service that combines API key management, audit logging, and common error handling.
5. **CQRS for LLM**
   Handle read (Query) and write (Command) operations on separate paths, optimizing caching and asynchronous processing.
6. **Async Batch Processing**
   Queue large document processing into batch queues and execute them asynchronously in parallel using worker groups.
7. **Priority-Based Throttling**
   Assign request priorities based on tenant or user type, prioritizing high-importance processes.
8. **Streaming Response Handling**
   Receive streaming API output through intermediate cache or load balancer and redistribute to multiple clients.
9. **Session Stickiness for UX**
   Route requests from the same session to the same model instance, maintaining consistent context.
10. **External Service Pattern**
    A design approach that delegates processing outside LLM's expertise to appropriate external services to ensure overall quality and efficiency.
11. **Composable Component Framework**
     Configure with plugin-capable components by functional unit such as loaders, splitters, embedders, and retrievers.
12. **Orchestration Engine**
    A workflow execution platform that can define LLM, tools, and DB operations with branching, loops, and parallelism.
13. **Agent Abstraction**
    Handle "agents" that integrate LLM and tool calls with memory management through a common interface.
14. **Layered Modularity & Core Abstraction**
     A multi-layer architecture that separates the core API layer from the plugin layer, coexisting stable core with external extensions.
15. **Multi-Region Fail-over**
    Automatically switch to geographically distributed model services to ensure continuous operation during disasters.
