# Collection of Practices for Utilizing LLMs in Production Systems

This document is a collection of practices for utilizing LLMs in production systems. It summarizes methods and approaches to solve challenges and barriers that arise when utilizing LLMs in programs and applications. Please use this document as a reference when working with LLMs.

Note that this document assumes the use of LLMs through APIs such as OpenAI API and Google Gemini API. This document is compiled with the understanding that many applications utilizing LLMs are leveraging them through APIs provided by LLM providers. If you are running LLMs locally, additional considerations are required.

## Table of Contents

[1_basic_foundation_practices](1_basic_foundation_practices): A collection of common foundation practices that serve as the "foundation" for safely and reliably integrating LLM APIs into applications.

[2_platform_integration_and_abstraction_practices](2_platform_integration_and_abstraction_practices): A collection of practices for implementing complex logic and applications using LLM APIs.

[3_prompt_engineering_and_content_orchestration_practices](3_prompt_engineering_and_content_orchestration_practices): A collection of practices for treating prompts as design assets rather than mere text, enabling complex generation flows and dynamic requirements.

[4_reliability_and_observability_practices](4_reliability_and_observability_practices): A collection of practices for stable 24/7 operation of LLM-based systems and rapid detection, analysis, and recovery from issues.
