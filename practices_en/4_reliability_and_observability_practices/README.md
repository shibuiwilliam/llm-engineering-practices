# Reliability & Observability

**Overview**  
Reliability & Observability practices are a set of practices for stable 24/7 operation of LLM systems and rapid detection, analysis, and recovery of issues. By applying these practices, you can improve SLA achievement rates, automate incident response, and establish a continuous quality improvement cycle.

- **Enhanced Availability**: Localize failure impact with failover and circuit breakers
- **Resilience**: Absorb temporary failures with retry/backoff and fallback mechanisms
- **Observability**: Visualize bottlenecks and anomalies with structured logs and traces
- **Alert Automation**: Detect silent failures with synthetic monitoring and Dead Man's Switch

## List of Included Practices

1. **Logging and Tracing**
   - Practices for detailed recording and tracing of LLM system operations. This makes it easier to understand system behavior and identify issues.
2. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Practices for detecting anomalies in LLM systems. This enables early detection and response to system abnormalities.
3. **Dead Letter Queue**
   - A queue for storing messages that could not be processed by the LLM system. This allows tracking of system failures and errors, enabling reprocessing later.
4. **Integrated Observability & Evaluation Hook**
   - A hook for integrating observation and evaluation of LLM systems. This enables detailed observation and evaluation of system behavior.
