title Structured Output Pattern

actor User
participant "Application\n(LLM Client)" as App
participant "LLM API" as LLM
participant "Output Parser\n(JSON/YAML/XML)" as Parser
participant "Downstream Service" as Downstream

User -> App : Submit natural language input
App -> LLM : Send prompt with structured output instruction
LLM --> App : Return structured output (e.g., JSON)
App -> Parser : Parse LLM response
Parser --> App : Parsed data (object structure)
App -> Downstream : Send structured data for processing

note right of LLM
Prompt includes instruction like:
"Respond using JSON format with fields:
name, description, score"
end note
