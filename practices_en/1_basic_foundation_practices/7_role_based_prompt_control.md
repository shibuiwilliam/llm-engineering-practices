# Role-Based Prompt Control

## Overview

Role-Based Prompt Control is a design practice that dynamically controls the content and constraints of prompts sent to LLMs based on the "role" of users or systems. This practice enables ensuring appropriate and safe outputs according to the user's position, authority, and situation, even within the same system. It also allows for achieving both personalized user experience and security policy compliance.

## Problems to Solve

Users of LLM-based applications are not always of the same persona or position. In general SaaS and cloud services, users have roles such as administrators, editors, and viewers, and the available features differ according to these roles.

In LLM-based systems, the available information and functions will also differ according to user roles. When these differences are reflected in prompt content, a mechanism is needed to change the prompts applied according to user roles. For example, if there is a prompt template for retrieving administrator-specific information, this prompt template should of course be prohibited from use by non-administrators. Role-Based Prompt Control manages prompt usage according to user roles.

- **Information Leakage Risk**
  - There is a possibility that general users might send prompts about administrator-only internal information from a chat UI, resulting in unintentional output of confidential information.

- **Output Inconsistency Due to Permission Mismatch**
  - Cases where users without operation rights could use administrator prompt templates to obtain responses about data deletion or setting changes.

- **UI/UX Consistency Degradation**
  - In business support AI, when accounting staff and engineers receive responses with the same prompt design, the content may be inappropriate or contain unnecessary information.

## Solution

In prompt design and control, we branch the output content and prompt behavior according to the "role" of users or context. Specifically, we adopt approaches such as:

- **Role-Based Prompt Template Management**
  - Prepare dedicated prompt templates for each role (administrator, general user, guest, etc.). Templates are managed in a hierarchical structure, separating common parts and role-specific parts.

- **Dynamic Prompt Control**
  - Select appropriate prompt templates based on user authentication information.

- **Output Filtering**
  - Adjust the level of detail and expertise of output content according to roles. Automatically filter confidential or inappropriate information.

## Applicable Scenarios

This practice is particularly effective in the following situations:

- Business AI systems requiring different response controls for administrators and general users
- Scenarios where multiple business departments use a common LLM but require different expressions and information levels
- SaaS products where output content needs to be separated for enterprise customers and free users
- Output tone control in LLM applications for children/adults
- Response control according to language and culture in multilingual systems

## Benefits

Adopting this practice provides the following benefits:

- Enables prompt control appropriate to user roles and usage purposes, reducing the risk of misinformation and unnecessary information.
- Can ensure safety at the prompt level as part of security policies and access control.
- Enables UI/UX personalization, improving user satisfaction and business efficiency.
- Maintains quality consistency through centralized prompt management.

## Considerations and Trade-offs

When adopting this practice, attention should be paid to the following points:

- Prompt templates may become complex for each role, potentially making management and maintenance cumbersome.
- If role determination and authorization logic are incomplete, there is a risk of using incorrect prompts, leading to output errors or information leakage.
- When role definitions depend on external applications (e.g., IdP), attention is needed for inconsistencies due to synchronization errors.
- Excessive role branching may increase system complexity.

## Implementation Tips

Key points for effectively implementing this practice are as follows:

1. It is recommended to start small by separating templates for main roles (e.g., admin, user, guest).
2. Introducing a mechanism to define common prompts for each role and override/add only differences (inheritance/differential design) improves maintainability.
3. It is effective to create a mechanism where role information is linked with session/authentication information and automatically applied during prompt generation.
4. In the testing phase, introducing output comparison and A/B testing for each role makes it easier to evaluate quality and consistency.

## Summary

Role-Based Prompt Control is an important design practice for achieving both output control and user experience optimization in LLM applications. By controlling prompts and responses according to user roles, both safety and personalization can be achieved. With appropriate role design and template management, flexible and robust LLM utilization becomes possible. However, it is important to appropriately adjust the granularity of roles and control complexity according to system scale and requirements.
