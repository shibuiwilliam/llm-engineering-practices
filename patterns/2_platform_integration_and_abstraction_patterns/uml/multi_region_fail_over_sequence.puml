title Multi-Region Fail-over Pattern - Fail-over Sequence

actor Client
participant "DNS Load Balancer" as DNS
participant "Health Checker" as Health
participant "Traffic Router" as Router
participant "Region A\n(LLM API)" as RegionA
participant "Region B\n(LLM API)" as RegionB
participant "Data Replicator" as Replicator

== Normal Operation ==
Client -> DNS: Request LLM Service
DNS -> Router: Route to Region A
Router -> RegionA: Forward Request
RegionA --> Client: Response

== Failure Detection ==
Health -> RegionA: Health Check
RegionA --> Health: Timeout/Error
Health -> Router: Alert Region A Failure

== Fail-over Process ==
Router -> DNS: Update Routing Table
DNS -> Client: New DNS Response (TTL)
Client -> DNS: New Request
DNS -> Router: Route to Region B
Router -> RegionB: Forward Request
RegionB -> Replicator: Sync State
Replicator --> RegionB: State Synced
RegionB --> Client: Response

note over Health,RegionA
  Health check detects
  region failure
end note

note over Router,DNS
  Update routing to
  healthy region
end note

note over RegionB,Replicator
  Ensure data consistency
  before serving requests
end note
