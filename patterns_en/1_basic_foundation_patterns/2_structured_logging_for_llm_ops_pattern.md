# Structured Logging for LLM Ops Pattern

## Overview

The Structured Logging for LLM Ops Pattern is a design approach for recording interactions such as prompts, responses, and metadata in a structured format (like JSON) in applications utilizing LLMs. This pattern enables efficient monitoring, quality analysis, test automation, and troubleshooting of LLM operations. Structured logs can be integrated with log aggregation platforms like Datadog, CloudWatch, Elasticsearch, and BigQuery to enable visualization, aggregation, and anomaly detection.

Additionally, we introduce a method to maintain log readability by outputting prompts to a dedicated data store rather than logs.

## Problems to Solve

LLM inference is composed of various elements:

- Input prompts
- Output prompts
- Models used
- Request parameters (Temperature, etc.)
- Request timestamps
- User information
- Others

Like other application systems, when failures occur, we can only know which information caused the error at the time of the error. Since unrecorded logs disappear, there's no question about the need to output sufficient information in logs. Also, to understand which information is related to quality improvement bottlenecks, we need to analyze logs.

On the other hand, the challenging aspect of managing LLM logs is that input/output prompts can become very large, and they may contain confidential information. Needless to say, when logs are filled with huge natural language text, it becomes difficult to read other logs. If confidential information is included, it becomes even more difficult to process logs appropriately.

1. **Difficulty in Tracking Failure Causes**
   - When users report "the answer was off-target," it's difficult to reproduce or investigate because we don't know which prompt or settings were used.

2. **Inefficient Analysis for Quality Improvement**
   - When wanting to compare which prompt templates or parameter settings produced high accuracy, extraction is impossible due to inconsistent and unstructured logs.

3. **Difficulty in Implementing Automated Testing and Alerts**
   - When wanting to monitor for anomalies in LLM outputs, analysis processing is impossible because logs are recorded in human-readable plain text.

4. **Log Readability Issues and Confidential Information**
   - When prompts are output directly to the log system, log readability and security are compromised.

## Solution

Record information such as prompts, responses, API call parameters, response times, model names, and user IDs consistently as structured logs in JSON format. By defining structured logs with the following fields, log analysis and quality monitoring become easier:

- `timestamp`: Log recording time
- `prompt_id`: Unique identifier for the prompt
- `user_id`: User identifier
- `model`: LLM model name used
- `temperature`: Temperature parameter during generation
- `input_text`: Input prompt
- `output_text`: LLM output
- `latency_ms`: Response time
- `status_code`: API call status

Additionally, prompt logs are not output directly to the log stream but are saved to a dedicated prompt log data store to maintain log readability and confidentiality. Logs in both the log stream and data store are managed with unique log IDs, and operations are conducted to view both as needed.

## Applicable Scenarios

This pattern is particularly effective in the following situations:

- When monitoring operations and visualizing SLA compliance in commercial LLM services
- Applications that frequently generate and send prompts, such as RAG or chatbots
- Processes for validating test prompts and evaluating LLM output quality
- Scenarios requiring tracking of user operations and system outputs for security or audit purposes

## Benefits

Adopting this pattern provides the following benefits:

- Ensures traceability of prompts and responses, making failure handling and user support easier.
- Enables analysis and aggregation of structured logs to evaluate and improve LLM accuracy.
- Makes it easier to build automated alerts and error detection logic.
- Can be utilized as a data foundation for future model comparisons and A/B testing.

## Considerations and Trade-offs

When adopting this pattern, the following points require attention:

- Since structured logs contain prompts and outputs, attention is needed to prevent leakage of personal or confidential information.
- When log volume becomes enormous, storage costs and log platform scalability need to be designed in advance.
- Standardization and testing of loggers are important to maintain log consistency and integrity.
- Excessive log output may lead to performance degradation, so log level and sampling control should be considered.

## Implementation Tips

Key points for effectively implementing this pattern are as follows:

1. Clearly define log schema and prepare common libraries to record in the same format for all LLM calls.
2. Use JSON or structured log formats to enable integration with log platforms.
3. Be conscious of log levels (info/debug/error) from the development stage and deploy to production gradually.
4. Incorporate logic to mask/filter personal information contained in prompts and outputs.

## Summary

The Structured Logging for LLM Ops Pattern is a fundamental and important design pattern for strengthening reliability, traceability, and quality management when utilizing LLMs in business. By standardizing structured logs and integrating with analysis and visualization platforms, it can demonstrate significant effectiveness across all phases of development, operations, and improvement. However, sufficient consideration is needed for log security and cost management.
