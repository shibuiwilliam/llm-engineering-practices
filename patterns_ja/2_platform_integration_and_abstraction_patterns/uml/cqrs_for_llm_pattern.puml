' External systems
cloud "LLM API" as llmApi

' Command flow
docInput --> cmdHandler : "Process Document"

worker --> llmApi : "Generate Embeddings"
worker --> vectorStore : "Store Vectors"

' Notes
note right of cmdHandler
  Handles document processing
  and embedding generation
end note

note right of queryHandler
  Manages search requests
  and response generation
end note

note right of cache
  In-memory cache for
  frequent queries
end note
